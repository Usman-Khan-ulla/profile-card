# profile-card

This project involves creating a profile card using HTML and CSS. The profile card is designed to display some basic information about an individual or a company, such as their name, title, contact information, and a brief description.

The HTML code provides the basic structure of the profile card, while the CSS code provides the styling and formatting. The profile card is designed to be responsive, meaning it will adjust its layout and sizing based on the device or screen size being used to view it.
